# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Anubhav, a 14yr old programming enthusiast who wants to become a physicist<br>

**My spellings are terrible, so please dont mind if I mispell anything** <br>

I code in:
- Mainly Python
- Trying Java
- Also Plan on Learning GoLang soon.<br>

**Also a member of Yet Another Developers Group (yet-another-developers-group.github.io)**

## Projects I've Worked On

Uptil now, most of my projects focused on AI and ML, including:
- A (Very Inefficient) Face Detection Algorithm
- An Image Autoencoder
- Various Popular AI models, including AlexNet and VGGNet
- A failed attempt at building a FaceGAN

Other projects i've worked one:
- Rhapsody: A Discord Music Bot (yet-another-developers-group.github.io/rhapsody)
- A Discord Rich Presence for Lichess (Cause i could not find one online)
- A Script to Download PPTs from Big Blue Button Presentations into a PDF file

## Projects I Have Planned for the Future
Some projects that I have planned, but I know I probably won't complete anytime soon:
- A Java framework to make it easier to use physics in your code
- Try and properly learn how to make a GAN model
- Learn GoLang and make a calculator using it (Cause why not)
- A model that detects exoplanets from publically available data from space telescopes
